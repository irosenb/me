				<p>Morse lets your audience be heard.</p>
				
				<p>Meetups like NYTM are usually a mess when it comes to the Q&A. People in the top row don't usually get called on to ask questions. And when someone asks a question, nobody can hear them.</p>

				<p>But everyone now has a phone. Why don't we use them? </p>

				<p>That's what Morse is. The way it works is that the conference is given a phone number. When it's Q&A time, people who have questions call the number and ask their question. In real-time, their voice is going over the loudspeakers.</p>

				<p>I'm still working on it. Let me know if you're interested in it.</p>

				<p><a href="http://coultonvento.com">Coulton Vento</a> and I built this at the Product Hunt hackathon using Ruby on Rails. We were 1 of 7 projects chosen to present in front of the entire hackathon.</p>

				<p>The next day we were <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/maker-hunt">featured</a> on the Product Hunt site. That drew over 16,000 views and comments from figures like <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/maker-hunt#comment_46970">Alexis Ohanian</a> and <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/maker-hunt#comment_46884">Ryan Hoover</a>.</p>

				<p>Presented MapHunt at Mashape's first <a href="http://blog.mashape.com/api-crafters-meetup/">meetup</a>. I talked about MapHunt's past, present, and future. Got a lot of awesome feedback about MapHunt.</p>

				<p>Made a <a href="https://tinyletter.com/maphunt">newsletter</a> for MapHunt. You should <a href="https://tinyletter.com/maphunt">subscribe</a> if you're interested in following along MapHunt's progress.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Medicine</h3>
			<div class="blib">
				<p>An iOS app and Arduino prototype that sends a push notification to your phone when you haven't taken your medicine.</p>

				<p>Built by myself using Arduino and Swift. Prototyped it with my pillbox. Uses Bluetooth Low Energy to detect when you're too far away. </p>

				<p>Medicine is not available for prime time yet. It's not on the App Store, nor is it on Kickstarter. I want to take the prototype and turn it into something more. Let me know if you're interested.</p>

Used the GoToWebinar API and Gumroad's Ping feature to simulate registering for a webinar.</p>
